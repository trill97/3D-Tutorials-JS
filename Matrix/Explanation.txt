HTML:

The body is styled to have no margin, hide overflow, and have a black background with green, monospace text.
A canvas element with the id matrix is added to the body.


JavaScript:

The canvas is selected and its context (ctx) is retrieved.
The canvas dimensions are set to the window's inner width and height.
An array of 256 elements is created and filled with the number "1". This array will be used to store the y-positions of the falling characters.
The draw function:
Fills the entire canvas with a semi-transparent black color to create the trailing effect.
Fills the text with green color (#0F0).
Maps through each element in the letters array, drawing a random character at the corresponding x and y positions.
Updates the y-position of each character. If a character moves beyond the bottom of the canvas, its position is reset to the top.
